Research Paper:


- What is the difference between React, and React Native?
React is used to build the user interface of web applications (ie, apps that run on a web browser). React Native is used to build 
applications that run on both iOS and Android devices (ie, cross-platform mobile applications). React uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
to create interactive user interfaces. React Native, on the other hand, uses native UI components and APIs to create mobile apps.

- Is React a framework or library?  What is the difference?
React is a library. One important distinction between libraries like React and frameworks like Ember.js and AngularJS is that React is 
concerned only with rendering the UI and leaves many things up to each project to put together.
Libraries are typically concerned with solving a narrow scope of problems. Frameworks attempt to provide an all-encompassing solution.

- What are the differences between HTML and JSX?
One of the major differences between HTML and JSX is that in JSX, you must return a single parent element, or it won't compile. 
In HTML, you are free to do whatever you want as you donâ€™t have to return a single parent element. JSX allows javascript to be directly 
incorporated into it.

- What makes React attractive for our case?
It's very popular and therefore has a ton of information and examples on the internet. The learning curve for React seems to be less 
steep than in the case of AngularJS.
